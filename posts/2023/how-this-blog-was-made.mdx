This post will be updated regularly with any changes to how I make/host this site. This is a simple, high-level overview of how I did this - for specific implementation refer toÂ https://github.com/jtpotato/jtpotato.github.io

### **Tech Stack**

- GitHub Pages
- Next.js
- framer-motion
- TailwindCSS (we don't hate on Tailwind here)
- Bun

### **Favicon**

[GitHub Identicons!](https://github.blog/2013-08-14-identicons/) Because I was running out of ideas and just wanted to get this site out as fast as possible.

# Blog

1. Read markdown files from a `posts` folder
2. Use `next-mdx-remote` to parse into Next.js
3. Use `gray-matter` to fetch data from frontmatter of each post

![The frontmatter of this post](https://github.com/jtpotato/jtpotato.github.io/assets/58995538/3a88153e-0c05-41ff-b20a-35398d3063c7)


The frontmatter of this post!

4. Compose the post page - title, published/edited dates
5. Apply styles (currently done through global css, should probably be changed at some point in the future)

MDX also affords us the opportunity to embed React components inside of the markdown, which could enable some cool things in the future. I've yet to find a use for it though.

The first part of the landing page.

- `framer-motion` for animations
- Blurred `<canvas>` background. Circles are given velocity and direction and constantly reprinted to canvas. Canvas is darkened after every frame to create a fade-out effect.
- Velocity of circles is affected by user scroll.
