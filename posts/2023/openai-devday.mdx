OpenAI made a series of announcements.

### Key Takeaways
- **GPT-4 Turbo**: Larger context, lower cost, new knowledge cutoff.
- **GPTs**: A new way to create customized chatbots for specific purposes, created through talking... to a chatbot??? Wild. Kind of like character.ai
- **GPT Store**: A new platform where users can browse, download, and share different GPTs for various use cases.
- **Copyright Shield**: Aims to protect OpenAI customers when legally threatened.

Quite a few posts have said that this event effecitvely destroyed a bunch of startups depending on OpenAI's API... and that's probably true. With the new GPTs and integration into other services people no longer need specific chatbots to talk to for writing/learning... (although, I never believed that people actually needed to anyway)

The choice to go all-in on the OpenAI ecosystem and develop app stores + a very simple way to build apps took a lot of people by surprise (including myself). While not predictable, in hindsight I do not see any other way that OpenAI could monetise an absolute banger of a product this well without hampering the experience.
