Given that everybody else has put out their opinion on what they think will happen in software next year... maybe I should do it too. As a student who isn't even in the industry yet there is a very decent chance that my predictions will be wildly inaccurate, but that just adds to the fun, doesn't it :)

## 1. Bun continues growing
This one is extremely obvious. However, many people do think that Bun will instead persuade Node.js to care about performance, rather than become the ubiquitous JavaScript runtime - at least temporarily. For some reason, I feel like it's a little different this time. Node.js is old enough that it needs to maintain backwards compatibility with many previous versions, and any rewrites to core functionality (such as what Bun has done) are incredibly difficult for the Node team. I believe we will see an ecosystem split between Bun and Node.js, where Node maintains legacy projects while Bun is used for creating newer ones. If this does happen, Node.js still has a very long and healthy future ahead of it, even if it isn't at the bleeding edge of performance.

## 2. Swift for Server makes it to mainstream
This one's a bit of a stretch. With work done by the Arc and Swift teams to port over as many developer tools to Windows as possible, the Swift team may now have enough expertise to continue porting tools to Linux, and achieving relative feature-parity between all major platforms. While I haven't tried Rust or Go very much - and therefore you really should take these opinions with a grain of salt, I still think Swift occupies a unique spot that allows it to take some scripting tasks, like Python does, while also allowing compilation to a fast executable with DX-focused features, like Rust and Go.

## 3. React UI Libraries become less popular
With the rise of shadcn/ui, I think developers have re-realised that installing JavaScript libraries can be as easy as copy-pasting code, without the need for package managers. This gives us more direct ownership of our components and allows us to extend them when we see fit. I don't see why new projects would choose to go with more "traditional" libraries like MUI (an argument can be made that shadcn/ui was the traditional way to do it, as that's how it was done even earlier...)

## 4. Continued layoffs/restructuring
Even reasonably large startups (i don't think they qualify to be considered startups anymore) such as Discord and Spotify still struggle to turn a profit - and as financial support for the industry in general starts dropping once investors realise that returns are so hard to come by, companies are going to have to make drastic changes in order to ensure that they can stay afloat.

I think we might see tech companies (especially startups) shrink while workers start moving to tech positions in non-tech, more established companies.
