A bit of a statement on owning our own content as creators:

Usually when people write blogs they tend to post onto medium.com. After all, it's the easiest platform. Everything is taken care of:
- Formatting
- Monetisation
- Hosting
- Analytics

For most people, this is fine. But as a user who doesn't really want to start paying for a Medium subscription, considering how rarely I use the platform, I've noticed that the platform locks many articles behind paywalls. Obviously, this is so that they can guarantee a higher cut for writers on the platform, which is nice, however it also means that as a user, I'm less encouraged to browse the platform as there isn't much content I can actually read there.

By moving content off of Medium, I get significantly more control over how my content is presented to you, how you are able to view it, and how I can monetise it. I'm not planning on stuffing this place full of ads, but having the control over *having ads in the first place* as well as where they go can ensure that I can still get something out of this - like I would have if I continued with writing on Medium, without placing anything behind paywalls.

# What about microblogging? Threads?
I think there's been a broader shift especially in the tech community when it comes to their written content - after seeing what happened to Twitter it's understandable why many of us now feel the need to actually own the distribution of more of our content. Sure, the algorithms help with reach, but it's important that we don't trust any single company in holding and distributing our data - and I believe this is one of the keystones of the Fediverse.
